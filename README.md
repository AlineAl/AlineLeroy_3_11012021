This is a project of Openclassrooms. Reproduce a model using responsive design and adding CSS animations.

## ðŸ’¾ Step by step

I was able to discover SASS with this project. Since then, it is a tool that I use for its practical and efficient side. With SASS we can arrange the contents by file, indent, make mixins...Mobile-first has made the implementation of responsive design easier.

Thanks to the sharing of other developers and the Openclassrooms courses, I quickly took over SASS. This project was also an opportunity to discover keyframes for CSS animations, a tool that I also appreciate. I could see the importance of the cubic-bezier, of the ease-in-out for a more natural and fluid animation.

## ðŸ”Œ Points to improve

When the code repeats itself, I should have thought about a better use of my variables with SASS. I'm also thinking of training myself to create more complex, more fluid animations. I know I can do animation with Javascript but I realize that CSS animation gives a lot of interesting animations.

In future projects, I plan to instead create a file that contains all the media-queries instead of one media-queries per content.
